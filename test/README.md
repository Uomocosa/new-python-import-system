# Test
These are the current tests for the `new_import_system` package
Each test is a package, with a different structure, and different imports.

All test can be run after you've installed `new_import_system` and `pytest` on your `venv` with the script `run_external_tests.py`
Or if you prefer I've created a task for vscode.
