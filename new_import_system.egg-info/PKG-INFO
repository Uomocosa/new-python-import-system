# Core Idea
**I dislike the python import system**.
_I want a package that I can import and it magically makes the import system smarter, and possibly to my liking_.
After you import this package:
- When you import a package, its subpackages, (if any) are lazy loaded automatically.
- If in a package/module you have a file/function named `__call__` or it has the same name as the package/module, then when you call the package/module that function gets automatically called.
- All `__init__.py` files in your project _should_ remain empty, I have not tested how they interact with this package.

### Tests
There are many tests in the `new_import_system_tests` folder, they can be all run from `new_import_system_tests\run_external_tests`.
I have made some useful `new_import_system_tests\.vscode\tasks.json`.

# Considerations
I need to consider many different cases
- If this is called after some packages/modules have been initialized, what should I do? Should I reload them? Should I populate their attributes?
- If this is called from a python -m ... command (so the sys.path and sys.modules are populized)
- If this is called from a python ... command (so the sys.path and sys.modules are kinda empty)
- How do I define a top_level_package (should I search for the last `__init__.py` from parents folders, for `setup.py`? for `pyproject.toml`? What happens if I find multiples?)
- Is the functions I use general enouugh? Are they "correct"?
- I would like to add this import hook at the **END** of `sys.meta_path`, but at the moment it is not possible, and is instead added at the start.

Any help is kindly apprechiated :)

# Current answers for my considerations.
As of now I try to:
- Get the top_level_package and re-import it.
- Get the caller_file for when an import is called using the `inspect` library.
- Throw a warning if it menages to import a package/module, but it results in a "_too-magical approach_".
- After you import this, every time you try to import a modules, if its a top-level package or subpackage it gets reloaded (_**ONLY ONCE PER PACKAGE**_). I do not know if `importlib.reload()` is fine to use ;;
